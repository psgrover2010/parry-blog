I wish someone would have told me this list before I moved here then I could have planned in my childhood. I must say moving to a new country can certainly a big change in my life, no matter how much I was traveling before, and have knowledge and experience. Living in a country & daily experience always give intercultural learning.

Undoubtedly, Vienna is a beautiful place to live in ( and one of the major tourist destination in Europe) and i don’t regret at all on my decision. I decided to write this post which will be bit different than the rest of the stories.

**Disclaimer:** If in this post there is something that counterbalance you – please have peace. We live under same sky, can breath same air and can have different opinions.

#### 1. First thing first - Immigration and registration

European Union / European Free Trade Association residents can enter in Austria without requiring a visa and can remain in the country visa-free, apart from those arriving from Croatia which still faces restrictions on long stays. However, anyone from the EU/EFTA staying for longer than four months will need to register locally in Magistrate office.

Those from outside the EU/EFTA moving to Austria will need to apply for a respective work permit or residence permit to stay in the country. For more information regarding Immigration rule & registration &nbsp;requirement I recommend to ask best law firm in Vienna, http://www.oberhammer.co.at/en.

#### 2. Where to live and how to find best accommodation

#### &nbsp;

Vienna has 23 districts in total and each Bezirk (districts) of the city has their own life-style. Choosing your district can often define your lifestyle in the city. It is easy to &nbsp;recognize the district by its zip code. It always start with a 1 for Vienna, followed by the two digits for the district and finally a number for a mailing sub-division (usually zero).

1010 = 1st district

1020 = 2nd district

.

.

.

1200 = 20th district

District: 1st (1010) & 2nd (1020)

Living here… will cost you high to low. District one is the main city centre, with numerous historical sites and very few residents. It can be in a penthouse or historic building. Second district is the island between the Danube and the Danube Canal, with amusement park Praterstern, with Giant Wheel and this place is the Vienna's most frequented traffic spot.

#### 3. Health insurance and social security benefits

&nbsp;

Both health insurance and social security payments are mandatory for all Dutch residents. Most long-term Dutch residents will be eligible for public health insurance. Private health insurance is also available for those who can't access public health insurance or want to be covered for extra treatments. Most foreign residents who move to the Netherlands are required to obtain public health insurance within four months of receiving their residence permit. Residents from EU/EFTA countries on short stay visits can use their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) but will need to switch to Dutch health insurance if staying for longer than a year.

The cost of Dutch health insurance is expensive compared to other European countries, with 6.75 percent of salaries covering basic medical care and 9.65 percent covering long-term nursing and care, but the Dutch healthcare system is of high quality and is rated as the best in Europe.

Social security contributions are mandatory for all, regardless of employment status, although some exceptions do exist. Details of exemptions can be found on the Dutch Social Security (SVB) website. The Dutch social security system is one of the most comprehensive in Europe and covers family benefits, maternity and paternity leave, unemployment benefits, long-term care, sickness leave and disability benefits.

For more information, see our guides to health insurance in the Netherlands, the Dutch healthcare system and the Dutch social security system.

Opening a bank account in the Netherlands

Opening a bank account when you move to the Netherlands is fairly straightforward. Most banks will have English-speaking staff and there are also financial providers who cater specifically for expat clients. To open a Dutch bank account, you will usually need to have valid ID (plus residence permit if applicable), your citizen service number (BSN) and proof of address. You may also be asked for proof of income, such as a payslip.

Most Dutch banks offer online banking. Credit cards and international money transfers are also commonly available although they are quite expensive.

The one-of-a-kind districts

How to find a Wohnung

Be prepared to dedicate some serious time to this task. With over 50% of the city dedicated to state-housing, the private rent market is small and competitive. Finding a Wohnung (apartment) in Vienna in the area you want requires patience and charm (directed at the real estate agent). Oh, and you’ll also need a bit of cash behind you, because in Vienna, the renter pays the real estate agent’s commission (typically 2 months rent). Unless you’re lucky enough to score one of the prized provisionsfrei apartments still being rented out by private owners. Shared apartment (WG / Wohngemeinschaft) living is common and a great alternative for students and young professionals wanting to get to know people in the city.

Useful vocabulary for apartment hunting in Vienna

Provision = real estate agent’s commission

Kaution = Security deposit

Altbau = a classy old building built before the war

Neubau = modern apartment complexes

Kalt = without gas and water costs in the rent price

Warm = with everything except electricity included in the rent price

Miete = rent

‘Befristeter’ or ‘unbefristeter’ Mietvertrag = a Befristeter Mietvertrag is a limited or short term rental contract. A standard one of these is limited typically to 3 years. Unbefristeter Mietvertrag means you can stay in the apartment for as long as you like. Rent will often be cheaper when the contract is befristet.

The top websites to look for an apartment

* Willhaben

* Toprop

* Der Standard

1. First things first, get the holy Meldezettel

The holy document known as the Meldezettel is your proof of existence in this city. Without it, you don’t exist in the eyes of the state. You need it to apply for everything, from a library card to getting your social security number, and ordering takeaway from your local Indian eatery (ok, maybe we made that last one up). It’s simple to get, and you’ll find more info. about how, here.

Vienna’s marketplace and classifieds for everything

London has Loot, America has Craigslist and Vienna’s go-to classifieds website for everything is Willhaben.at. Here, second-hand furniture and other stuff is bought and sold, and apartments, housemates and jobs are found. Another useful online fleamarket is Shpock.

Getting connected: meeting people in Vienna

Moving to a new city can be like the first day of school all over again (perhaps, minus the peeing of pants and that embarrassing breakdancing incident that led to the school being evacuated – you know what we mean, right?). The best way to deal with the ‘settling in’ stage in Vienna is to throw yourself – kicking, screaming, biting lip, peeing pants – into the mass of other people also experiencing the initial adjustment stage. Vienna is full of internationals, and locals alike, wanting to connect. You’ll find many of them at the bar of the many Irish pubs around the city (we’ve made a useful list for you here of the city’s best Irish bars)

Otherwise, here’s a list of communities where you can find them

* Internations Vienna (a professional expat networking group hosting regular events)

* Vienna Expats (a mixed group of expats meeting on a regular basis in a casual setting)

* Women of Vienna

* Vienna & Diplomatic (an online club that offers luxury items at exclusive prices for expats and Diplomats and hosts regular events)

* Vienna Business Agency Expat club (A good club for expats in business)

* AWA (A international group of Expat women helping and connecting women in Vienna.

* Vienna Babies Club (a expat network of international families)

Expat Facebook groups

* English speakers in Vienna

* British in Vienna

* Americans in Vienna

1. Language is hard. I mean: real hard.

No, seriously. Sources disagree, but I read that it’s one of the hardest in Europe, and possibly in the world. It’s estimated that a person needs about 4 years of study to reach fluency (and I am not studying).

First of all, there are some factors that don’t encourage you to learn it at all. You can live in a social bubble that doesn’t speak Czech, for example. Or, you can just panic and stop going out altogether. I would know, I tried it.

But if you try to learn the beautiful language, at the beginning you feel like everything is against you. Accents and digraphs make for a stunning 42 characters in the alphabet (nice, uh?). Some sounds are also very specific to learn, with the terrible Ř that will give me troubles until the end of my life. It sounds like a drrj, by the way.

And then, grammar starts.

Take a verdammten German course: learning the language

While most speak fluent English in this city, they say (who ever they are) that you live a new life for every new language you speak. Well, we suggest you get started with your new Vienna life with ze’ language of its soul – German. Ok, well, the Viennese’s wild and wonderful version of German – Wienerisch. However, Viennese you’ll learn on the street, but first you need to sign yourself up for a German course. Don’t lock yourself away in an expat bubble. Doors open in this city when you learn to sweet talk in ze’ German. Denglish (German with English words scattered throughout) is also accepted as a charming alternative, as well. Here’s a few places to learn your German that we recommend:

* Deutschakademie (cheap intensive courses)

* Universit&auml;t Wien Deutschkurs (this one comes highly recommended, intensive semester courses at the University for very low prices)

* i-diom: Professionelles Sprachtraining (for a professional German course)

1. Live like a local: dive into Austrian culture

Don’t be one of those expats that bring their habits and cultural etiquette from home, cling to it for dear life and spend their whole time comparing home with here – news flash: you’re living in a different country! While after the honeymoon period of first moving to Vienna wears off, many expats are tempted to indulge in a bit of ‘verbal-Austrian-bashing’ for the rude service, their anal ways, their rigid mentality, their sleepy lock-down Sundays, amongst other things. We recommend refraining from such verbal farts. This will only take your eye off the place you’re living in – an eccentric, individual kind of city that has a bundle of charming characteristics. Spend your time getting to know Vienna’s wine and wandering culture on the fringe of the city, the ‘Schaumamalmal’ work-life balance, the pleasure of coffeehouse procrastination, the culture and classical music on tap, and the many grassroot creative stuff happening in the city. Vienna will not serve itself to you on a platter. It plays hard-to-get, hide and seek with you, and dares you to explore and live it independently.

Learn how to cope with quiet Sundays and prep’ for them accordingly

Vienna shuts down on Sundays and if you’re outside of the touristy city center, don’t be surprised if you spot some tumbleweed making its way across the street (warning: levels of exaggeration may be present). That’s right, even the stores are closed. While this may annoy many, we see this 7th day of solace is an opportunity. We hereby declare Sunday to be the day of exploration in Vienna, when man, woman, child and the strange guy who stares at us on the bus every morning, unite in a common pursuit to venture out into parts of the city they never normally would if the shops were open. The city is surrounded by forests and vineyards, while the inner city hosts a bundle of galleries to wander around in for hours, and hectares of green space to get active in, or to just take a walk. One of our favourite Sunday activities is simply strolling through a district we’ve never seen before.
