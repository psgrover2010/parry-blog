Christmas Season in Vienna is always special to everyone\! This will be our 4th season and we are already excited about it as entire city will decorated for amazing view with millions of lights as we do celebrate light festival of Diwali in India. It will be worth to see this season in Vienna as all streets for shopping, buildings & Vienna squares turn into wonderful Christmas Markets starting from mid of November.

Do not miss a hot cup of Punsch, Gl&uuml;hwein or Tea. It gets really cold in Vienna on these days hence what will be the best then these drinks.

There are many Christmas Markets in Vienna but the most popular and best in class or I would say the one I like the most is Christmas Markets at Wiener Rathausplatz, Maria-Theresien-Platz, Karlskirche and Schönbrunn Castle.

##### **Why these are favourite?**

The Advent Market at these places always stands out from the crowd of Christmas markets that encircle the Vienna city.

These places have best crafts stands selling beeswax candles and carved wooden angels. These craft are handmade locally.

There is also a large focus on organic products here, including an organic Gl&uuml;hwein and Punsch stand. The market frames the man-made pond which has been emptied of water, and filled with children playing in piles of hay and flying around in four-wheeled bikes. It is a family affair early in the evening. This is all the while under the holy glow of the towering Karlskirche and a spiderweb of fairy lights. This one is a favourite for many.

##### **The best Gl&uuml;hwein or Punsch?**

Try the Thai Punsch at Jörgs H&uuml;tte (last stand on the right of the Karlskirche) or head to the stand named ‘Zum Franz’ which is directly in front of the kids playground in the middle, facing the church. The Birne-Vanilla Punsch here is delicious.

##### **Don't Miss:**&nbsp;

Take the chance to put your kid in a bird’s cage on the recycled Lost and Found carousel by Mowetz & Co. Also, be sure to stuff your face with one of the sweet (with berry marmalade) or savoury (with sauerkraut) Krapfen at a stand located in the middle somewhere (you’ll find it – just follow the kids).
