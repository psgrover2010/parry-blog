This is something comes with perfection. The more you do , the more you realize & learn everything of it. I do take free session online and practice. I take this as my hobby and I am not saying my photos are good but not that bad.

It's always been about seeing something, knowing how you want it to look, and seeing it in the first place is what makes a photographer. Photography also gives me a reason to travel and explore new places. Most people get the pleasure of memorable experiences when they travel somewhere new or go on holiday. I also get to put my creativity, and my passion for photography, into action.

What does your photography mean to you?
