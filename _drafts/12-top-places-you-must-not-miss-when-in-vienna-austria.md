Amritsar is the largest city in Punjab and well-known as the home to the holiest shrine of Sikhism — Sri Harmandir Sahib, also known as the Darbar Sahib or Golden Temple. This place is one of the most revered places of worship for Sikhs all over the world. It’s well worth spending some time exploring the sprawling complex. Amritsar isn’t just about sacred sites (although there are many to explore). The holy city is also a must-stop street food destination, and home to plenty of museums, forts, and bustling bazaars and markets.

Amritsar is a big town with a population of about one million. Darbar Sahib is a Gurdwara (Sikh Temple) located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is the holiest Gurdwara and the most important pilgrimage site of Sikhism. This has been built in the 1600s, it houses a copy of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the holy text of Sikhism, which is read out loud by a Granthi (reader) for visiting pilgrims to listen to.

Darbar Sahib is surround by a body of water called the Amrit Sarovar, or Pool of Nectar, which pilgrims either bath in or sit besides, contemplating higher matters. In keeping with the Sikh tenets of hospitality, the temple is surround by a complex that contains sleeping quarters and a huge kitchen, providing pilgrims with accommodation and sustenance.

Harmandir Sahib complex has a Langar, a community-run free kitchen and dining hall. Food is served here to all visitors who want it, regardless of faith, gender or economic background. Vegetarian food is served and all people eat together as equals. Everyone sits on the floor in rows, which is called pangat. The meal is served by volunteers as part of their kar seva ethos. A simple meal is served round the clock. Tea is also served separately near the entrance of the Langar hall, 24 hours a day.

This sikh temple is intended to be a place of worship not only for the Sikhs but for people from all religions all over the world. The four entrances to the Golden Temple symbolize the acceptance of the Sikhs towards all people and their religion. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people visit this temple on a daily basis. The main temple is built on a 67 ft. platform in the centre of water tank (also known as the Sarovar). It is connected by a bridge which is 202 ft long and 21 ft wide.

Irrespective time of the day, you will always see long queues of patient pilgrims on the bridge waiting to pay their respects at the temple. Whenever I visit, it took me few hours’ time before I could finally reach inside and pray in the premises, do not FORGOT to admire the upper two floors before departing.

A quick note to the readers; be prepared to stand in line for 1-1.5 hours whenever you are visiting the Darbar Sahib, Amritsar.

In my every visit, I sat down at the banks of the Sarovar and continued to stare at temple watching the changing hues and colours as the evening progressed into night. The view of the Golden Dome in the evening and night is a marvellous.

Darbar Sahib has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.

#### Getting to and from

Taking a pre-paid taxi is the best and most efficient means of getting to and from Amritsar airport or Railway Station. Taxi service is available outside the building. The journey into town takes around 20 minutes and a taxi will run you between INR 300 and 400. Using an autorickshaw can be your best bet for getting around in Amritsar. Agree on a price before you hop on, but prices are generally reasonable. For example, an autorickshaw from the train station to the Golden Temple usually costs around INR 100. Speaking of the Golden Temple, there are free yellow shuttle buses that run between the train station and the Golden Temple from 4am to 9pm.

#### Things to do in Amritsar

Take a dip in the holy Sarovar (holy pond) and explore the site, visited by millions of pilgrims and tourists from all over the world. If you have time and you’re hungry, don’t miss a meal at the langar, the largest free community kitchen in the world, which feeds upwards of 100,000 people a day. The kitchen is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The only road border crossing between India and Pakistan, Wagah, lies between Amritsar in India and Lahore in Pakistan. This is the place to come to witness the Wagah Border Ceremony, which involves the lowering of the flags on both sides of the border.

Also referred to as the beating retreat border ceremony, the highly choreographed ritual involves music, coordinated movements, and lots of pomp and circumstance. The ceremony takes place every evening before sunset and lasts about 45 minutes.

Get your history fix by exploring Maharaja Ranjit Singh Museum, a museum dedicated to Maharaja Ranjit Singh, otherwise known as the “Lion of Punjab.”

No matter where you go in India, you’re likely to find some pretty amazing food, but each state and even city or town have their own delicacies. In the case of Amritsar, one of the delicious things they’re famous for are their kulchas (butter-soaked bread baked in a tandoor and often stuffed with potatoes). Try one out. This is a fab place with buzz and atmosphere and our visit much helped by staying in a proper hotel with hot water, lifts and a very comfy bed!

#### <br>1. Must visit Haveli In Amritsar

Haveli is recently opened restaurant on Amritsar highway and just a watchable place in Amritsar. It is just about 15 km away from Amritsar city. Food is too tasty and their hospitality and service is appreciable. Restaurant’s interior is awesome.

#### <br>2. Heritage Walk

The bustling streets surrounding the temple are a delight to walk through. &nbsp;Not only you get to learn about this city’s fascinating history, you also get to experience its sights and sounds.

As the sun sets, the entire place is bathed in beautiful yellow lights. You are in awe of its beauty and feel mesmerized.

You may wander through busy bazaars selling a mix of Fulkari textiles, colorful turbans, beautiful parandas, shawls, scarves, and more.

#### 3. Wagah Border

You can either rent a cab or take a Hop on Hop off Bus to Wagah Border, about 17 miles from Amritsar in order to witness Indian Border Retreat Ceremony. The rich heritage tour of the Hop on Hop off Bus that takes you to Wagah border starts from Golden Temple and other locations. You may find more information here. It’s thrilling to watch the ceremonial closing of the gates and the lowering of the flags of India and Pakistan.

#### 4. Jallianwala Bagh

Just a few minutes’ walk from Harmandir Sahib is Jallianwala Bagh, the place of great historical significance. It is the site of the 1919 massacre of Indian citizens by British. There are well-manicured gardens blooming with color with pathways making a perfect spot for walkers. It has a light and sound show too.&nbsp;

the site of a massacre of peace protesters by the British army. Admire the Maharaja Ranjit Singh Statue where earlier use to be a fountain chowk or roundabout. This change is very imprecise as it depicts the grand image of warriors of Punjab in red and black stone with stone cut visuals of animals. It looks equally interesting thorough the day.
