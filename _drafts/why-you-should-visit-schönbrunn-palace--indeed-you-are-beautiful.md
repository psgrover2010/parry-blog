Would suggest to take the grand tour and explore all 40 rooms wherein you will see the state rooms and private apartment of Franz Joseph and Sisi.

This tour will cost you approximate EUR 18 per adults and EUR 12 aged between 6 to 18.

You can explore the imperial rooms with a guided tour which will obviously cost you some more bucks however would recommend to explore on your own with a tour description/audio guide which is free of charge.<br>&nbsp;

Recommended place to visit:

Palace are quite impressive and worth admiring if you are interested in History and original old things.<br>You will be able to see the original furnishing, King and Queen living standard, children room, study room etc unfortunately, no photography is allowed within the Palace.&nbsp;

In addition to visiting the palace, it is also worth spending time in the Sch&ouml;nbrunn Garden and Park as well as the Palm House which is one of the largest green houses in the world.

After our tour of the palace we went to explore the Sch&ouml;nbrunn gardens. Gardens are always my favourite part of palaces!
