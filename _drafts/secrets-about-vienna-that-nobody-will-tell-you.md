Vienna is one of the best City in the world to live. The quality of living is high in standard and that’s why this city has been ranked the most liveable&nbsp;***city***&nbsp;in the world for the 10th year in a row, closely followed by&nbsp;**Zurich**&nbsp;in&nbsp;**Switzerland**.

&nbsp;

This city has become my second hometown and I have seen that tourists attracts from all over the world. It is not hard to see why the place is stunning. So, come and enjoy the beautiful place in the world with great architecture.

&nbsp;

I have seen tourist making mistakes which can be avoided if real facts known — here is the list as local not to make mistakes when you are in Vienna in Austria.

&nbsp;

* I think every city has its good points and its bad points. The public transport system in Vienna is one of good point. It is Cheap, frequent, fast, clean, efficient, relatively safe. Sometimes tourist generally forget what public transport is for. Please do not treat the tram like a gondola ride. There are many people who are not on vacations and going for work so respects others and when on an escalator, stand on the right side only\!
* Vienna is the city which works on an honesty system in terms of public transport. There are no ticket barriers at stations and no formal, permanent ticket checks on local trains, trams and buses. You just hop on and off unchallenged. This doesn't mean public transport is free, though. Please buy your tickets before traveling as ticket can be randomly checked and you will be penalized for huge fine and no explanation will be tolerated if you are tourist and do not know German etc.
* There are two different lanes and very easily visible. One is for pedestrians; one is for bikes. Bikers are insane and are everywhere in Vienna during whole year around specially very high in summer so stay out of the bike lanes and be careful while riding a bike or e-scooter.
* Vienna and Austria as a whole country has best tap water in the world. Tap water is available throughout city so avoid bottled water in hotels and restaurants: Save your money\!
* Crossing: Just stick to lights and pedestrians as breaking rule is strictly not allowed. Recommended not just by locals however also by the police.
* Vienna Card: This city also offers a tourist card but only offers negligible discounts and is pretty pricey - so decide your place to visits and double check before you buy if it really is going to save you money.
* Do me and yourself a favour and avoid the tourist trap of eating a Sacher Torte at the Hotel Sacher. It is overpriced and full of tourists. A city has full of amazing cafes that sell lovely Sacher Torte is less price.
* Skip CAT train from Airport – Unless you are in a rush to get in the city, I would recommend to skip the City Airport Train. It’s cost more than ten euro compared to the regular train that is only around four euro. The time difference is slight so save money.
* Stay with a local via Couchsurfing as it is a great way to save money and another way to meet a local who can help you in the city.
* Flixbus is budget-friendly way to get around the country. Cheap and reliable and they have WiFi on the go & electrical outlets for long-haul bus journeys.
