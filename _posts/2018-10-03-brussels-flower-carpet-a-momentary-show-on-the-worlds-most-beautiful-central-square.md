Every year, the Grand-Place in Brussels, Belgium celebrates anniversary as a&nbsp;**UNESCO world heritage site**. As an agenda local celebrates that with…

Flowers, lights and fireworks!

In few hours with more than hundred volunteers this can be made quickly for visitors to have a splendid view of this ephemeral masterpiece. The view from ground level is a site to see, the above ground view is to die for. If you won’t get the tickets for Panorama view then do not be gloomy as the lighting is amazingand the ground level view of the buildings within the Grand Place is equally impressive.

#### When did this happen first?

The very first Flower Carpet was created in 1971 in Brussels. And it has been running non-stop every two years since 1986. A non-profit association assembles a committee of professionals who come up with the design and plan.&nbsp;

#### When is the next?

We saw the Flower Carpet in 2018, so next will happen in 2020 and it repeats in every 2 year. Do not think much and head to Brussels in August. For future dates, check the official [website](http://www.flowercarpet.brussels/en){: target="_blank"}.

#### **Where Can You See?**

The Flower Carpet is located in the gorgeous Grand Place, in the heart of Brussels. If you head across to Town Hall (called “Hotel De Ville” – It’s not a hotel) and walk up to the balcony you can get a great birds eye view of the flowers.

The carpet was approximate 100m and composed by about 120 volunteers, with nearly 1 million begonias in less than 4 hours. The 2018 theme of the flower carpet was Mexico. The Flower Carpet is dedicated to Guanajuato, a Mexican region with a particularly rich floral culture and tradition.&nbsp;

It was a memorable journey to Brussels.&nbsp;
