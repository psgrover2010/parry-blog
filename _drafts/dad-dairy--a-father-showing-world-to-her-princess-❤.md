My little panda! Since you were born i wanted you to know couple of things. It’s been a lovely journey to see u devolve bit by bit.

My all worries and stress fly into sky when you hug me and tells me about all the various kind of interesting experiences which you gone through in your day specially at Kindergarten. You are always on my mind, waiting for me to come back from office, and as soon as i entered in the room listening to your joyful crying " Papa, Papa". All of my tensions and stress are relaxed at that moment when u kiss me and i kiss you on your head and ask you " how are you "❤

As a father i do understand your own lovely language, which is not understand by everyone. It is amazing to see you grow up into beautifully smart woman. My lovely daughter, as you will grow in the life, you will go through various changes around you, it can either come from society, family, relationships, career and many more but you have to be strong to face them all, don’t worry, believe in God & always fight with yourself love! For every father's heart, there always come a time in life when their darling daughter step out of house either for education or for marriage, i promise I will always with you in each and every step of your life, supporting u throughout your life and guiding you if you are wrong! I will respect your decision and i want u to respect mine too. You have to led the way for yourself from out of your dream to discover the world outside. You will have to take that huge plunge to explore, analyse and evolve.&nbsp; I believe in you my princess and u need to believe in yourself too! And always remember that God is always with you! Have faith in him.

There will be sometime when you will miss mouth-watering food served by mom, warm and tight hugs from us , miss our aura around you , the comfort of getting everything at a go, but that's fine , ultimately you will learn to sail, adjust, and compromise and be happy with what you have.

Stepping out of ur comfort zone will help u to know the true shades of life and test ur adaptability and capability in lot of ways .My dearest panda , with a sudden boost in accessibility to technology to everybody , it has started affecting the behaviour of people directly , i want u to know that&nbsp; social media is a part of every day life , but it isn't life itself.<br>Now the time has come where people led lives accordingly what happens in someone's else. They have grown insecure , aggressive , envious via social media. Human have started feeling unsure Of the way they lead their lives , seeking for validation from Random people and friends on social media.The dire urge to crave acceptance regarding one's way of living, dressing up , thinking , visiting places or eating has added to the mental chaos to the world<br>In addition to this , i want to tell u something my love , don't grow to be insecure , and aggressive . You have ur own place in this universe and nobody else but you can only fill that void. Trust yourself and the way u exist because if u r confident in ur skin , nobody can ever dare to raise their voice .

Let only urself ponder over ur actions , beliefs , feelings , ways of living and nobody else can control ur frame of mind .<br>For everything u read or listen , don't blindly accept it but reflect upon it . Insecurities grow out of comparison but u never have to compare urself to nyone. Remember u r one of a kind. Some people will lead a life more luxurious than u , full of lustre , shine , pomp and show and there is no doubt about that.But whether you live a life happier than others that's ur call . Happiness is very personal and each one of us have different reason to be happy. Grow ambitious , get insipred by people ,their way , dress sense , way of living, to one day to build it for urself in ur own way. Remember u can't be embodiment of anyone else , hence u sudnt try . Do things that make u feel proud of urself. Remember it is always easy to fulfill someone's else expectations but to meet urs by performing to ur best capability is the toughest .if u can satisfy urself , u ll never need a validation from the world .Above all of this , Be humble and kind to people.Be benevolent and something that can be sorted out by talking , don't use fist for the same. but yes , if something goes beyond control and fist is needed , punch hard for the other one to remember for long period.Defense can never be weak , don't try to bring people down to prove a point. If u have a valid arguement , nobdy will shunk to shun them away.There is always a way to get ur talk across the table. Learn to believe urself , confide into me or ur mom if u wish to discuss. We shall always lend u an ear. Remember a mob is so big for a reason and u hve to choose if u wish to be a part of it or to stand out on ur own. Don't worry love i m never going to push my opnions down ur throat . I ll always listen if u validate with reasons.Always remember that ordinary is the new beautiful ❤ , you know that , the ordinary never fits in the perception of beauty , each one of us wishes to be different , off the crowd but nobody wishes to be the part of mob , yet it is the mob that forms the world. We lack the spirit and eye to detect the beauty in usual things and that's why our sense of beauty stands distorted and skewed. You know it's easy to get drawn towards something wich looks beautiful . The real task however is , to dig out marvels out of something which looks ordinary , Honey , i want to explore beauty in normal and ordinary things , because as when John Keats said " Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder " he perhaps talked about the ordinary beauty , because to spot that u need an eye. I see people wanting to do a lot and achievd so much&nbsp; in their lives just to be happy ! I am not telling u to not work or educate for the sake of money and luxurious life full of happiness and peace , i m jus giving u the other perspective to be happy and relaxed when u feel evrythg is finished and u r done from life. Happiness is the ultimate goal each of us r aiming through various ways and measures .All of us want to be happy and that's so ordinary. If u see an infant smile which is the most radiant one because it is unembellished , untouched and the usual kind . Hence ordinary is beautiful ❤. Loving the ordinary is what takes courage and passion . When someone ask u to spot the beauty i want u to take time out to feel the beauty in its minute forms and lived endlessly and then pay heed to it. The most ordinary things are the most beautiful things because their beauty is a matter of ur effort and patience to dig it out. People have lost patience , the patience to halt , look for a while and engage themselves into something and then fall for it. The day we learn to breathe well, halt in that moment and live it to that brim , we will learn to actually love and cherish the ordinary. Remember humans are ordinary where luxurious are special and i hope u know what to choose over what my little panda bear !&nbsp; Mankind is ordinary yet most fascinating and beautiful creation of&nbsp; cosmos .Hence , ordinary is the illusion , complex , yet so sorted just like us , the humans ❤ This letter of mine will not end like this ,<br>Now let's talk about an emotion which is going to pave its way into ur life very soon . It is called Love and the world has a plethora lot of things to say about it , But please don't take it as the ultimate truth of the day . Let's build up " Love" for you.Love to&nbsp; me ,&nbsp; is the most abstract yet most fulfilling emotion that one can feel . You can share it with anyone - a man , woman , an animal, or for that matter a thing that is dear to you. It doesn't know a gender , caste, creed or colour , but just fill each soul to the brim without any disparity. But it isn't easy to fall for somebody's imperfections .Love afterall isn't easy, it needs patience .During the coming years u ll feel attracted to a man , know that each of us are meant to be loved and cared for .Love after all is the only universal&nbsp; uniting factor&nbsp; to mankind.Also , it cannot be found by conscious hunt .It isn't a mine waiting to be dug.you will instead happily stumble upon it. So wen it has to happen , it will happen honey. You just have to be there living in that moment , it might also leaves and perhaps , the very next moment. But u know what is perfectly fine because love is about that very moment which made u feel alive and not the sadness that lingers post is left. Love never leaves , people do. It always comes from the most unexpected comes. Love is thus , like an infant and a pot in making.&nbsp; So love freely , passionately and let it go. Sometimes I will disappoint u too but give me sometime i will bounce back.It is love that world needs the most.<br>I want u to have the kind of love that tests u , but for only ur good , it must make u grow not only as a partner but also as an individual .Honey the world will tell u that love comes in specific shapes , sizes , colours , castes , genders, and races ,

But know that love doesn't follow these demarcated lines It transcends beyond all these petty and baseless societal norms. Love doesn't know boundaries because it&nbsp; just binds and knits people equally well wherever it brews. They will tell u that a girl only falls for a guy who have whitish complexion because this is much desirable and skinny girls with sharp features&nbsp; makes the best partner , they will assert that upper caste must marry an upper caste, An asian shouldn't fall for amercian or amercian shouldn't fall for african or an indian shouldn't fall for someone who is not of their caste and so on.know all these notions are made my pseudo intellectuals Trying to set the norms of the day bcoz they never get what they wanted.These people bifurcate love and sell it in the market of religion , caste and gender . Probably they never felt the true essence of love because this experience is global and rise above all this sham.U will fall in love or probably not. Either way little , it is perfectly fine , it is not unusual for u to never feel attracted towards anyone. It is simply a matter of ur personal inclination and choice .you&nbsp; will be free and mature to take a call for urself . nobody gets to decide that on ur behalf ever.
