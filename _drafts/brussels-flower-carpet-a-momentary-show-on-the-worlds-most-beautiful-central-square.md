In few hours with more than hundred volunteers this can be made quickly for visitors to have a splendid view of this ephemeral masterpiece. The view from ground level is a site to see, the above ground view is to die for. If you won’t get the tickets for Panorama view then do not be gloomy as the lighting is amazingand the ground level view of the buildings within the Grand Place is equally impressive.

Read quick **Five Ws** information to plan wisely.

#### What is flower carpet?

In every 2 years in August the Grand Place in Brussels is always covered with a flower to celebrate the anniversary as a unesco world heritage site. Dates are not fixed however it’s always in August hence please plan in advance so you don’t miss this life time event.

#### When did this happen first?

The very first Flower Carpet was created in 1971 in Brussels. And it has been running non-stop every two years since 1986. A non-profit association assembles a committee of professionals who come up with the design and plan.&nbsp;

#### When is the next?

We saw the Flower Carpet in 2018, so next will happen in every 2 years. Do not think much and head to Brussels in August. For future dates, check the official [website](https://www.brussels.be/flower-carpet){: target="_blank"}.

#### Where Can You See?

The Flower Carpet is located in the gorgeous Grand Place, in the heart of Brussels. If you head across to Town Hall (called “Hotel De Ville” – It’s not a hotel) and walk up to the balcony you can get a great birds eye view of the flowers.

#### Where else might you see in Europe?

I am sure this happen nowhere else in Europe. Prove me wrong with the details and picture in the comment section.

We took the opportunity in year 2018 and visited from 16 to 18 August and witnessed the amazing Flower carpet at the Grand-Place in Brussels, Belgium.

The carpet was approximate 100m and composed by about 120 volunteers, with nearly 1 million begonias in less than 4 hours. The 2018 theme of the flower carpet was Mexico. The Flower Carpet is dedicated to Guanajuato, a Mexican region with a particularly rich floral culture and tradition.
