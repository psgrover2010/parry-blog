Living in a city and exploring bit by bit is completely a different experience. Sch&ouml;nbrunn has natural beauty in all season especially spring & winter are amazing seasons & if you are visiting in spring then it is a very calm time at Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace. Strolling through the park is a wonderful experience in all seasons.

We witness a huge and beautiful famous Christmas market here and in Easter time people love to taste the gluhwein to keep them self-warm with surrounding beauty. Approximately 8 to 9 million people visit the &nbsp;Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace, park and its attractions each year.

**Opening Times:**

1 April to 30 June - (8 am to &nbsp;5.30 pm)

1 July to 31 August - (8 am -to 6.30 pm)

1 September to 4 November - (8 am to 5.30 pm)

5 November to 31 March - (8 am -to 5.00 pm)

Palace is child friendly however please keep an eye on your kids as visitors are not allowed to tuch the things and photography is also probhited. Last entry is one hour before closing time and pets are also not allowed in the park and palace.

**How to reach:**

Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace is just a quick ride on the U-4 subway from centre station Karlsplatz. I would recommend to visit the palace & garden in morning time. Take U4 (green line) underground subway and get down at Sch&ouml;nbrunn station. Exit platform from lift side and go right opposite the traffic. It's just a 5-minute walk to main entrance.

**Tickets, Price and Tour:**

Tickets can be purchased at the entrance center at the main gate when you come in (on the left). Please expect a queue and a waiting time in peak season. At first, don't stand in queue as if you can pay through credit/debit card then go in and find out self-machine on the left side & buy tickets your own if that has less number of people.

You will get the tickets for next tour which will start in another hour & so hence you will get few more minuets before you go in. There is beautiful view on the back side of palace in case you want to explore before your tour starts. Bags can be stored at tour entrance & you can carry baby stroller as palace is very much wheelchair accessible. &nbsp;&nbsp;

There are many self tour with audio guide. I would suggest to take the grand tour and explore all 40 rooms wherein you will see the state rooms and private apartment of Franz Joseph and Sisi. You can explore the imperial rooms with a guided tour which will obviously cost you some more bucks however would recommend to explore on your own with a tour description/audio guide which is free of charge. This grand tour will cost you approximate EUR 18 per adults and EUR 12 aged between 6 to 18.

**Things to know before you visit Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace**

There are many different tours and ticket options available depending on how much of the palace you want to see. All tours come with an audio guide.

When you purchase your ticket, you will be assigned an entrance time. I was quite impressed with how the entrances were staggered every few minutes, as this prevented huge crowds of people trying to push through the rooms all at the same time.

The palace is open daily, including public holidays. The palace always opens at 8:30 am. Closing times are 5:30 pm in the spring and fall, 6:30 pm in the summer and 5:00 pm in the winter.

Ticket sales start at 8:15 am and last admission is 30 minutes before closing time.

Park gates open daily at 6:30 am. Dogs are not allowed in the park.

There is a cafe in the Gloriette if you work up an appetite wandering the gardens.

Try and catch a classical music concert at the Orangery in the evening.

The Vienna Card will give you a small discount on the price of admission.

**Recommended place to visit:**

Palace are quite impressive and worth admiring if you are interested in History and original old things.<br>You will be able to see the original furnishing, King and Queen living standard, children room, study room etc unfortunately, no photography is allowed within the Palace.&nbsp;

In addition to visiting the palace, it is also worth spending time in the Sch&ouml;nbrunn Garden and Park as well as the Palm House which is one of the largest green houses in the world.

After our tour of the palace we went to explore the Sch&ouml;nbrunn gardens. Gardens are always my favourite part of palaces!
