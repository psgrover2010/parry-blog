Split, it’s a town on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast and very famous for its beaches & the fortress like complex at its centre, Diocletian's Palace. It was build by the Roman emperor in the 4th century. You will find numerous shops, bars, cafes, hotels and houses surrounding.

#### 1. Admire Statue of Grgur Ninski

This is one of the best & huge sculptor in the town, you will easily find this nearer the town and around the Diocletian Palace. This is next to the Golden Gate however this statue was initially stationed on Diocletian Palace’s peristyle.

During WW II, Italian occupying forces removed the statue, recognizing its meaning to the population. When Split came back under Croatian control, statue returned & now its outside the Palace’s northern entrance, entitled “Golden Gate”. I personally feel that this statue is quite impressive & monumental, especially if you take a closer look, you will also notice that statute thumb on one of his feet shines with a unique color. You will also find visitors are rubbing the toe and making a wish which will gradually make that wish happen.

And naturally, as with millions of other similarly unproven beliefs, people accepted this as well and starting rubbing the toe as if it is a lucky charm. When I spoke to local regarding this then some says girls wishes and got married & few students received good grades etc etc.

With such events, it is difficult to differentiate which cases of astonishing wish-granting might have happened thanks to Gregory and his thumb. This gives a people actual power & confidence to achieve their goals.

#### 5. Hiking in Marjan Hills

 

Park is open all year round and the best time to visit is in the morning. According to Law on protection of natural environment of the Republic of Croatia, Park-forest Marjan is the area under special regulations. Therefore, witin the entire area of the park-forest, it is strictly prohibited to smoke or use any kind of open flame!

I must say this hiking has many, many steps (no wonder why the people of Split are so trim and fit!) take you from the Veli Varos neighborhood up and up until you come to Café Bar Vidilica with a splendid view that encompasses all Split and a good number of its off-shore islands. At the foot of Marjan hill are several of Split's most interesting museums, including the Mestrovic Gallery and the Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments. And some of Split's best beaches lie at the foot of Marjan hill.

How to reach

Bus line 12 which will take you to the most popular beaches on Marjan hill. However, there are no buses that will get you all the way up the hill, but you can get a taxi to take you most of the way. The cost would be 50kn or so from the center of town.
