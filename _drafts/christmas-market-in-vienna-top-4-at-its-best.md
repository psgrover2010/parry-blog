Christmas Season in Vienna is always special to everyone\! This will be our 4th season and we are already excited about it as entire city will decorated for amazing view with millions of lights as we do celebrate light festival of Diwali in India. It will be worth to see this season in Vienna as all streets for shopping, buildings & Vienna squares turn into wonderful Christmas Markets starting from mid of November.

Do not miss a hot cup of Punsch, Gl&uuml;hwein or Tea. It gets really cold in Vienna on these days hence what will be the best than these drinks.

There are many Christmas Markets in Vienna but the most popular and best in class or I would say the one I like the most is Christmas Markets at Wiener Rathausplatz, Maria-Theresien-Platz, Karlskirche and Schönbrunn Castle.

##### **Why these are favourite?**

The Advent Market at these places always stands out from the crowd of Christmas markets that encircle the Vienna city. These places have best crafts stands and these craft are handmade locally.

There is also a large focus on organic products, including an organic Gl&uuml;hwein and Punsch stand. It is a family affair early in the evening.

##### **The best Gl&uuml;hwein or Punsch?**

Do not miss Thai Punsch at Jörgs H&uuml;tte (it can be last stand on the right of the Karlskirche) or try at stand named ‘Zum Franz’ which is in front of the kids playground in the middle, facing the church. Birne-Vanilla Punsch is also delicious.
