If you are a traveler then you should visit LINZ as i am sure you don't want to miss a ride on a train which is the steepest adhesion railway in Europe which creates a harmonious combination of nostalgia and modernity through its design.

Yes, I am talking about the Pöstlingbergbahn which reaches to small hill Pöstlingberg- almost a mountain and located in the northern part of Linz.

The day I come to know about Pöstlingberg, I had decided to explore it in my next visit to Linz.

LINZ is a small and beautiful city which is located in northern part of Austria. This city is not famous like Salzburg, Innsbruck and Vienna which often get all attention from tourist however this is the third largest city in Austria. It has many interesting sights and great tourist destination to explore.

City has many historical buildings, great architecture and modern innovations to offer as other high-ranking Austrian cities.

Since 2014 Linz has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities network. Finally, I had a chance to visit Linz and then it was the time to explore old and stylish tram with WOW view. This ride comes with lots of fun with scenery and many things to do at the top of the Pöstlingberg so overall this is well worth the journey.

It took me only 20 minutes to climbs Linz & reaches high in mountain. This starts from centre of Linz, starting from Hauptplatz and on its way it passes the Anton Bruckner University and the Zoo.

**Pöstlingberg Caf&eacute; Lounge:**

The pastry shop Jindrak in Linz took over the restaurant Pöstlingberg Caf&eacute; Lounge. The name of the caf&eacute; has remained the same, and all of the additional confectionery Jindrak has been added.

**Timetable:**

It runs daily till 10.30 pm. (= last slide),

Monday to Saturday: from 6 am., Sundays and public holidays: from 7.30 am.

Tickets are available from ticket machines at the stop or from Tourist Information Linz on Hauptplatz.

**Price**

Uphill and downhill journey 6,40 €

Uphill and downhill journey (reduced fare) 3,20 €

Uphill or downhill journey 3,90 €

Rest assured you will admire the cityscape of Linz and plenty of beautiful scenery during the trip. On-top of this quiet area of Linz is the Basilica church, the Grottenbahn attraction and several restaurants and caf&eacute;s.

**Grottenbahn:**

TAKE THE BIZARRE DRAGON EXPRESS THROUGH LINZ’S GROTTENBAHN

A trip on the Dragon Express through Linz's Grottenbahn spirits visitors away into the realm of dwarves, forest animals and fairy tales.

The Grottenbahn will enchant you with scenes from famous fairy tales, and takes visitors back to the olden days with a stroll on Linz Hauptplatz in miniature at the turn of the century. A great excursion destination for families\!

Tip: [Linz-Card](https://www.linztourismus.at/en/leisure/plan-a-trip/linzcard/) holders receive a discount on the Grottenbahn ride and many other benefits.

**Boat Ride on Danube:**

The Danube river is one of the finest (and longest) in Europe and it is worth taking a boat trip to admire the city from a different perspective in any city that this river runs through.

There are many different boat tour options in Linz from short to half an hour trips in Danube or if you are interested then take the longer half day trips to Vienna.

**GETTING TO LINZ:**

I found easiest way to get into Linz is by train. The train between Salzburg and Vienna stops in Linz. Train journey in Austria is always hassle free. Daily transport pass costs EUR 4,50 and if you love exploring city on foot like me then it’s a twenty minutes to half an hour walk from the train station to the town centre.
