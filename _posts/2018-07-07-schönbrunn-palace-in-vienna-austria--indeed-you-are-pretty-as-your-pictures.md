Living in a city and exploring bit by bit is completely a different experience. Schönbrunn has natural beauty in all season especially spring & winter are amazing seasons & if you are visiting in spring then it is a very calm time at Schönbrunn Palace. Strolling through the park is a wonderful experience in all seasons.

Palace is child friendly however please keep an eye on your kids as visitors are not allowed to tuch the things and photography is also probhited. Last entry is one hour before closing time and pets are also not allowed in the park and palace.

**How to reach:**

Schönbrunn Palace is on the U-4 subway and easily reachable from anywhere within the city. A quick ride of 10 minutes ride from centre station Karlsplatz. I would recommend to visit the palace & garden in morning time especially for best photography session and avoid crowd. Take U4 (green line) underground subway and get down at Schönbrunn station. Exit platform from lift side and go right opposite the traffic. It's just a 5-minute walk to main entrance. You can also reach by Tram line 10 & 60 and bus 10A.  

**Tickets, Price and Tour:**

Tickets can be purchased at the entrance center at the main gate when you come in (on the left). Please expect a queue and a waiting time in peak season. At first, don't stand in queue as if you can pay through credit/debit card then go in and find out self-machine on the left side & buy tickets your own. If you want to avoid the crowd then visit the palace before 10 or after 14:00.

You will get the tickets for next tour which will start in another hour & so hence you will get few more minuets before you go in. There is a beautiful view on the back side of palace in case you want to explore before your tour starts. After purchasing a tickets, bags can be stored at tour entrance & you can carry baby stroller in as palace is very much wheelchair accessible.

There are many self-tour with audio guide. I would suggest to take the grand tour and explore all 40 rooms wherein you will see the state rooms and private apartment of Franz Joseph and Sisi. You can explore the imperial rooms with a guided tour which will obviously cost you some more bucks however would recommend to explore on your own with a tour description/audio guide which is free of charge. This grand tour will cost you approximate EUR 18 per adults and EUR 12 aged between 6 to 18.

**Things to know before you visit Schönbrunn Palace**
