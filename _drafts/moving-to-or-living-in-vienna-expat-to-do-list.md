I wish someone would have told me this list, before I moved here though I was aware of many however not completely. I must say moving to a new country can certainly a big change in my life, no matter how much I was traveling before, and have knowledge and experience. Living in a country & daily experience always give intercultural learning.

Undoubtedly, Vienna is a beautiful place to live in (and one of the major tourist destination in Europe) and I don’t regret at all on my decision. I decided to write this post which will be bit different than the rest of the stories.

#### 1. First thing first - Immigration and Registration

European Union / European Free Trade Association residents can enter in Austria without requiring a visa and can remain in the country visa-free, apart from those arriving from Croatia which still faces restrictions on long stays. However, anyone from the EU/EFTA staying for longer than four months will need to register locally in Magistrate office.
{: .present-before-paste}

Those from outside the EU/EFTA moving to Austria will need to apply for a respective work permit or residence permit to stay in the country. For more information regarding Immigration rule & registration requirement I recommend to ask best law firm in Vienna, http://www.oberhammer.co.at/en .

**Secondly, to get the holy Meldezettel**
{: .present-before-paste}

The townhall registration document known as the ‘’Meldezettel’’ is your proof of existence in the city. Please remember this must be completed within 3 days as of arrival and vice-versa when you leave Austria permanently. This is also applicable if you change your address from one place to other.
{: .present-before-paste}

Without it, you don’t exist in Austria as you need it to apply for everything, from a library card, Bank account to getting your social security number. It’s simple to get, and you’ll find more info here- https://www.wien.gv.at .

#### 2. Where to live and how to find best accommodation

Vienna has 23 districts in total and each Bezirk (districts) of the city has their own life-style. Choosing your district can often define your lifestyle in the city. It is easy to recognize the district by its zip code. It always starts with 1 for Vienna, followed by the two digits for the district and finally a number for a mailing sub-division (usually zero).

#### 4. Health insurance and social security benefits

Both, Health insurance and social security payments are mandatory for all Austria residents. All long-term residents will be eligible for public health insurance & private health insurance is also available which will benefit you extra treatments. Most foreign residents who move to the Austria are required to obtain public health insurance. Residents from EU/EFTA countries on short stay visits can use their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) but will need to switch to Austria health insurance or International Insurance if staying for longer.

#### 5. Opening a bank account in the Austria

Opening a bank account in Austria is fairly straightforward like other country. Most banks will have English-speaking staff and there are also financial providers who cater specifically for expat clients. To open an Austria bank account, you will usually need to have valid ID and proof of address (Meldezettel).
{: .present-before-paste}

Most Austrian banks offer online banking. Credit cards and international money transfers are also commonly available although they are quite expensive. I would recommend to use TransferWise- https://transferwise.com &nbsp;or Western Union- https://www.westernunion.com &nbsp;or any other in similar way.
