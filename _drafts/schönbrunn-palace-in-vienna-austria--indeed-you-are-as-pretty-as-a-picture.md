Living in a city and exploring bit by bit is completely a different experience. Sch&ouml;nbrunn has natural beauty in all season especially spring & winter are amazing seasons & if you are visiting in spring then it is a very calm time at Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace. Strolling through the park is a wonderful experience in all seasons.

**How to reach:**

Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace is on the U-4 subway and easily reachable from anywhere within the city. A quick ride of 10 minutes ride from centre station Karlsplatz. I would recommend to visit the palace & garden in morning time at lebefore 10 for best photography session . Take U4 (green line) underground subway towards H&uuml;tteldorf and get down at Sch&ouml;nbrunn station. Exit platform from lift side and go right opposite the traffic. It's just a 5-minute walk to main entrance. You can also reach by Tram line 10 & 60 and bus 10A. &nbsp;

**Tickets, Price and Tour:**

Tickets can be purchased at the entrance center at the main gate when you come in (on the left). Please expect a queue and a waiting time in peak season. At first, don't stand in queue as if you can pay through credit/debit card then go in and find out self-machine on the left side & buy tickets your own.

There is a beautiful view on the back side of palace in case you want to explore before your tour starts. After purchasing a tickets, bags can be stored at tour entrance & you can carry baby stroller in as palace is very much wheelchair accessible.

There are many self tour with audio guide. I would suggest to take the grand tour and explore all 40 rooms wherein you will see the state rooms and private apartment of Franz Joseph and Sisi. You can explore the imperial rooms with a guided tour which will obviously cost you some more bucks however would recommend to explore on your own with a tour description/audio guide which is free of charge. This grand tour will cost you approximate EUR 18 per adults and EUR 12 aged between 6 to 18.

**Things to know before you visit Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace**

* All tours come with a self audio guide.
* After purchasing a ticket, you will be assigned to particular entrance time. This is to avoid huge crowds of people trying to push through the rooms.
* Ticket sales start 15 minutes before the first tour starts i.e. 8:15 am.&nbsp;
* Park gates open daily in early morning at 6:30 am. Pets are NOT allowed in the park.&nbsp;
* There are plenty of cafe and resturants in garden and I like the most in the Gloriette as you can have sip in the morning walk while wandering the gardens.
* If you have Vienna Card then you will get a small discount on the price of admission. check this at tickets counter before purchasing a ticket.&nbsp;

**Recommended place to visit:**

In addition to visiting the palace, it is also worth spending time in the Sch&ouml;nbrunn Garden and Park as well.&nbsp;
